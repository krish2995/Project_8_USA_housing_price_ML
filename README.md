3. Advanaced EDA
4. Feature engineering
5. splitting data and train the model
6. evaluvating the model

## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.11.3

## Setup

At the end, you want to make sure that people who are interested in your project can create an identical environment on their own computer in order to be able to run your code without running into errors. Therefore you can create a `requirements file` and add it to your repository. You can create such a file by running the following command: 


- `Step_1:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :


- `Step_1:` Update Chocolatey and install Node by following commands:
    ```sh
    choco upgrade chocolatey
    choco install nodejs
    ```

- `Step_2:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-Bash` CLI :
  
    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 

 **`Note:`**
    If you encounter an error when trying to run `pip install --upgrade pip`, try using the following command:

   ```Bash
   python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
